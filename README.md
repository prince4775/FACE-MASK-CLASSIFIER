# Face Mask Classifier

## Project Domain / Category
**Image Processing / Deep Learning**

## Abstract / Introduction
The Face Mask Classifier is an AI-driven solution designed to automate mask compliance monitoring. This system identifies individuals in three categories:
- **With Mask**: Properly wearing a mask covering the nose and mouth.
- **Without Mask**: Not wearing any mask.
- **Improperly Worn Mask**: Mask improperly worn (e.g., below the nose or chin).

By leveraging deep learning and computer vision, this project aims to enhance public health and safety in crowded spaces while minimizing human intervention.
